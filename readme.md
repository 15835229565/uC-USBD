# uC/USB-Device

μC/USB-Device is a compact, reliable, high-performance stack designed for embedded systems equipped with a USB device controller.

µC/USB-Device supports several standard device classes (CDC, HID, MSC, PHDC). A Vendor class is also provided for developing vendor-specific USB devices. Thanks to a hardware abstraction layer, you can easily port μC/USB-Device to any new USB device controllers by simply modifying existing hardware access routines.
